## First guide: How to reproduce the paper's results
After cloning the repo, you should:
1. install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
2. run the following command in the terminal:
 ```bash session 
 uv run python paper_results/main.py
 ```
  This will run the python script for comparing the aggregation rules and saving the results. You will be asked to enter your preferences, like choosing the dataset, the number of voters and the number of simulations.
